# Crawler Recursion Error Fix

## Task Objective
Fix the maximum recursion depth exceeded error in the appointment monitoring system to ensure reliable operation.

## Current State
The crawler component in `appointment_monitor.py` is failing with "maximum recursion depth exceeded" errors, causing the entire monitoring cycle to abort after a single successful cycle.

## Future State
A more robust crawler initialization and management system that prevents recursion issues and can safely recover from failures.

## Implementation Plan

1. Fix crawler initialization process
   - [x] Add initialization flag to prevent recursive setup calls
   - [x] Modify `setup_crawler()` method to check flag before initialization
   - [x] Ensure flag is reset in failure cases and cleanup

2. Improve error handling in monitoring cycle
   - [x] Ensure cleanup between cycles to avoid stale crawler instances
   - [x] Add proper flag resets throughout code
   - [x] Add more robust error handling in crawler operations

3. Implement auto-recovery mechanisms
   - [x] Update main function to support auto-restarts
   - [x] Create external restart script for complete process failures
   - [x] Update start.sh to use restart script

4. Additional reliability improvements
   - [x] Add exponential backoff for restart attempts
   - [x] Add detailed logging for monitoring restart attempts
   - [x] Reset initialization flags in all key methods

## Updates
[2025-05-06] Implemented all fixes after analyzing the recursion error pattern in logs.
